\frametitle{1. Kleinian groups}

A \textcolor{blue}{Kleinian group} is a \textcolor{red}{finitely generated} and 
\textcolor{red}{discrete} group of \textcolor{red}{conformal} symmetries of the 
\textcolor{dgreen}{sphere}, where

\begin{enumerate}
\item{``the \textcolor{dgreen}{sphere}'' means the round unit sphere in Euclidean 3-space; and}
\item{``\textcolor{red}{conformal}'' means smooth maps which preserve angles.}
\end{enumerate}

The collection of all conformal symmetries of the sphere is a \textcolor{blue}{Lie group}; ``\textcolor{red}{discrete}''
means discrete as a subset of this group.

If we identify the unit sphere with the \textcolor{dgreen}{Riemann sphere} 
$$S^2 = \CP^1:=\C\cup \infty$$
then (orientation-preserving) conformal symmetries are \textcolor{red}{fractional linear
transformations}
$$z \to \frac {az+b} {cz+d}$$
and the group of all such transformations is $\PSL(2,\C)$.

\frametitle{2. Differential Equations}

Kleinian groups arise in nature as monodromy groups of \textcolor{dgreen}{differential equations}.
\vskip 5pt
Euler introduced the \textcolor{blue}{hypergeometric equation}
$$z(1-z)\frac {d^2w}{dz^2} + [c - (a+b+1)z]\frac {dw}{dz} - abw = 0$$
where $w$ is a function of the variable $z$, and $a$, $b$, $c$ are real constants.
\vskip 10pt
For Euler, $w$ and $z$ were real; but for us they can be complex numbers.
}
\frame
{The space of solutions to the hypergeometric equation
is a complex vector space $V$ of dimension 2. 
\vskip 10pt
There are \textcolor{dgreen}{regular singular points}
at $0$, $1$ and $\infty$, and solutions may be \textcolor{red}{analytically continued} 
around these points.
\vskip 10pt
If $f$ and $g$ are a basis for $V$, the map $$D:z \to f(z)/g(z)$$ is well-defined
in the \textcolor{dgreen}{upper half plane}
$$\HH:=\lbrace z \in \C \text{ with positive imaginary part} \rbrace$$
}
\frame
{
Schwarz showed that the image $D(\HH)$ is a \textcolor{dgreen}{curvilinear triangle} $T$ in $\C$
whose sides are segments of \textcolor{red}{round circles} or \textcolor{red}{straight lines}
and whose angles are $|1-c|\pi$, $|c-a-b|\pi$ and $|a-b|\pi$.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{Schwarz_triangle.png}

}
\frame
{
If we \textcolor{red}{analytically continue} $D$ across a segment of 
$\R - \lbrace 0,1,\infty\rbrace$, it maps
the lower half plane $\overline{\HH}$ onto a triangle obtained from $T$ by \textcolor{dgreen}{inversion}
in the corresponding circular side (or \textcolor{dgreen}{reflection} in a straight side).
\vskip 10pt
Continuing $D$ around loops, we get a
representation 
$$D_*:\pi_1(\CP^1 - \lbrace 0,1,\infty\rbrace) \to \PSL(2,\C)$$ 
}
\frame
{
If the angles of the curvilinear triangle $T$ are of the form $\pi/n$ for integers $n$, 
the image of $D_*$ is discrete, and hence is a Kleinian group
called a \textcolor{blue}{triangle group}.

\frametitle{3. Hyperbolic geometry}
Poincar\'e realized that $\PSL(2,\C)$ is also the group
of (orientation-preserving) \textcolor{red}{isometries} of hyperbolic 3-space $\H^3$.
\vskip 10pt
In Poincar\'e's model, $\H^3$ is the interior of the unit ball.
The hyperbolic metric is obtained by rescaling the Euclidean metric
by a factor of $2/(1-r^2)$ where $r$ is the distance to $0$.
\vskip 10pt
Straight lines in the Poincar\'e metric are arcs of Euclidean
straight lines or circles perpendicular to the boundary sphere.

If $\Gamma$ is a torsion-free Kleinian group, then
$\Gamma$ acts \textcolor{red}{freely} and \textcolor{red}{properly discontinuously}
on $\H^3$ by isometries.
\vskip 10pt
Thus the quotient $M:=\H^3/\Gamma$ is a \textcolor{blue}{hyperbolic manifold}
with universal cover $\H^3$, and fundamental group $\pi_1(M)\cong \Gamma$.
\vskip 10pt
Conversely, every 3-manifold $M$ with a \textcolor{red}{complete} hyperbolic
metric has universal cover $\widetilde{M}$ isometric to $\H^3$, realizing
the deck group $\pi_1(M)$ as a Kleinian group $\Gamma$.
}
\frame
{
Thurston conjectured, and Perelman proved, the 
\vskip 10pt
\textcolor{blue}{Geometrization Theorem}: a closed 3-manifold $M$ admits a hyperbolic structure if and only if
\begin{enumerate}
\item{every smooth embedded sphere in $M$ bounds a ball;}
\item{$\pi_1(M)$ is infinite; and}
\item{$\pi_1(M)$ contains no $\Z^2$ subgroup.}
\end{enumerate}
}
\frame
{
\frametitle{4. Dynamics}
If $\Gamma$ is a Kleinian group, the sphere $S^2$ decomposes into 
\begin{enumerate}
\item{the \textcolor{blue}{Limit set} 
$\Lambda$ where $\Gamma$ acts \textcolor{red}{ergodically}, and}
\item{the \textcolor{blue}{Domain of discontinuity}
$\Omega$ where $\Gamma$ acts \textcolor{red}{properly discontinuously}.}
\end{enumerate}
$\Lambda$ is closed, and $\Omega$ is open. For torsion-free 
Kleinian groups, $\Lambda$ is the closure of the set of fixed points of $\Gamma$.
\vskip 10pt
The quotient $\Omega/\Gamma$ is a Riemann surface. Ahlfors showed it is of
\textcolor{dgreen}{finite type}; i.e.\/ it is homeomorphic to a compact surface
minus finitely many points.

A random walk in the Euclidean plane is recurrent. In higher dimensions, it diverges, but
very slowly and chaotically.

In hyperbolic space of any dimension, the negative curvature \textcolor{dgreen}{freezes} 
the trajectory of a random walk, so that it converges to a definite point on the sphere
at infinity.

\frame
{
If $\Gamma$ is a Kleinian group, \textcolor{red}{measurable functions} on $\Omega/\Gamma$
are the asymptotic values of \textcolor{red}{harmonic functions} on the hyperbolic
manifold $M:=\H^3/\Gamma$.
\vskip 10pt
So whenever $\Lambda$ is not equal to $S^2$ there are many harmonic functions on $M$.

{
If $M$ is a closed hyperbolic manifold, there are no nonconstant harmonic functions on $M$,
by the \textcolor{dgreen}{maximum principle}. So $\Lambda = S^2$.
\vskip 10pt
But it {\em is} possible for $\Lambda = S^2$ even if $M$ is noncompact!
}
\frame
{
\textcolor{blue}{Example:} $\Sigma$ is a surface, and $\phi:\Sigma \to \Sigma$ is
a diffeomorphism. Define the \textcolor{red}{mapping torus}
$$M_\phi:=\Sigma\times [0,1]/(s,1)\sim(\phi(s),0)$$
which is topologically a bundle over $S^1$ with fiber $\Sigma$:
$$\Sigma \to M_\phi \to S^1$$
}
\frame
{
There is a corresponding short exact sequence of fundamental groups
$$0 \to \pi_1(\Sigma) \to \pi_1(M_\phi) \to \Z \to 0$$
In particular, $\pi_1(\Sigma)$ is a \textcolor{red}{normal} subgroup of $\pi_1(M_\phi)$.
\vskip 10pt
If $\phi$ is sufficiently complicated, Thurston showed $M_\phi$ is hyperbolic.
}
\frame
{
Let $\widehat{M}_\phi$ be the infinite cover of $M_\phi$ with fundamental group
$\pi_1(\Sigma)$. Topologically, $\widehat{M}_\phi = \Sigma \times \R$.
\vskip 10pt
Since $\pi_1(\Sigma)$ is \textcolor{red}{normal} in $\pi_1(M_\phi)$, it follows that
$\Lambda(\widehat{M}_\phi)$ is invariant under all of $\pi_1(M_\phi)$; in fact
$$\Lambda(\widehat{M}_\phi) = \Lambda(M_\phi)$$
But $M_\phi$ is closed, so $\Lambda(M_\phi)=S^2$.
}
\frame
{
Each fiber $\Sigma$ is a surface, whose universal cover
$\widetilde{\Sigma}$ is topologically a plane, which is properly embedded in
$\widetilde{M}_\phi\cong \H^3$.  
\vskip 10pt
This plane accumulates on $\Lambda(\widehat{M}_\phi)=S^2$; i.e.\/ it limits to all
of $S^2$!

\frametitle{5. Ahlfors' Conjecture and Tameness}
In 1966, Ahlfors formulated his
\vskip 10pt
\textcolor{blue}{Ahlfors Measure Conjecture:} If $\Gamma$ is a Kleinian group, then either
$\Lambda=S^2$ or $\Lambda$ has measure zero.
\vskip 10pt
If $\Gamma$ violates Ahlfors conjecture, we can build a function $\chi_\Lambda$ on $S^2$
which is $1$ on $\Lambda$ and $0$ on $\Omega$, and a nonconstant harmonic function
$h_\Lambda$ on $M:=\H^3/\Gamma$ which is zero on $\Omega/\Gamma$.
}
\frame
{
A random walk preserves the value of a harmonic function \textcolor{dgreen}{on average}.
If $\Gamma$ violates Ahlfors conjecture, a random walk on $M:=\H^3/\Gamma$ has
a definite chance of failing to converge to $\Omega/\Gamma$.
\vskip 10pt
Where else can a random walk go? It has to go into one of the \textcolor{dgreen}{ends} of $M$
and \textcolor{red}{stay there}.
}
\frame
{
The manifold $M:=\H^3/\Gamma$ has $\pi_1(M)\cong\Gamma$ which is finitely generated.
\vskip 10pt
The \textcolor{blue}{Scott Core Theorem} says that there is a \textcolor{red}{compact}
\textcolor{blue}{core}
$C \subset M$ such that $C \to M$ is a homotopy equivalence.
\vskip 10pt
The \textcolor{dgreen}{ends} of $M$ are the components of $M-C$.
\vskip 10pt
Some of these ends limit to components of $\Omega/\Gamma$; these are the 
\textcolor{red}{geometrically finite} ends.
}
\frame
{
\textcolor{blue}{Example:} The cyclic cover $\widehat{M}_\phi=\Sigma \times \R$ has two \textcolor{red}{geometrically
infinite} ends. The surfaces $\Sigma \times t$ have bounded area, 
so a random walk on $\widehat{M}_\phi$ looks like a random walk on $\R$.
\vskip 10pt
But a random walk on $\R$ is recurrent! So the random walk on $\widehat{M}_\phi$ will not
stay in either of the ends, but keep coming back to any compact region.
}
\frame
{
Thurston and Canary showed that to prove Ahlfors Conjecture, it suffices to show that the
ends of $M:=\H^3/\Gamma$ are all topologically products $\Sigma \times \R^+$. Such ends
are said to be \textcolor{dgreen}{tame}.
\vskip 10pt
In 1974, Marden conjectured that all hyperbolic manifolds $M:=\H^3/\Gamma$ are 
\textcolor{dgreen}{tame}; equivalently, they are all homeomorphic to the interior of a
compact 3-manifold, possibly with boundary.
\vskip 10pt
In 2004, Marden's \textcolor{blue}{Tameness Conjecture} was proved independently by
Agol and by Calegari--Gabai; thus by the combined work of many people,
we know that Ahlfors' Conjecture is true.
